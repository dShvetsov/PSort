"Madame has been out for a walk but has returned now," answered the
"Madame" and her husband’s name. Nevyedovsky affected to be not merely

"Mamma will be down directly. She was very much tired.... Yesterday..."
"Mamma! I ... I ... didn’t..." he said, trying to make out from her
"Mamma, I’ll go up to her."
"Mamma, couldn’t I speak to her?" said Kitty, watching her unknown
"Mamma, darling, for goodness’ sake, don’t talk about it. It’s so
"Mamma, how did papa make you an offer?" Kitty asked suddenly.
"Mamma, is it true?" said Kitty’s voice.
"Mamma, take my earrings. They bother me. You’re not afraid? Quick,

"Mark my words, Alexander will not come," said the old princess.
"Married already?"

"No, Stiva," she said, "I’m lost, lost! worse than lost! I can’t say yet

"No, no, it can’t be! No, for God’s sake, you are mistaken," said Dolly,
"No, no, let me be, I’ll stay."
"No, no," said Kitty in a voice shaking with tears.
"No, no," she said, smiling and holding his hand. "It’s sure to be

"No, not the least!" Nikolay answered, vexed at the question. "Tell him

"No, nothing will happen, and don’t think about it. I’m going for a walk
"No, papa, he’s very nice, and Kostya’s very fond of him," Kitty said,
"No, please tell me!"
"No, please, let us stay here."

"No, thank you, I won’t have any more tea," said Levin, and conscious of
"No, thank you. We can manage very well now."
"No, thanks, I can’t drink any more," said Levin, pushing away his

"No, you can ask anyone you like," Konstantin Levin answered with

"No," he broke in, and unconsciously, oblivious of the awkward position

"No. Do you want anything?" Alexey Alexandrovitch asked without

"No; and what do you talk of Sergey Ivanovitch for?" said Levin,
"No; did I say that? I only said I was disappointed."
"No; don’t unpack till tomorrow, and let the carriage wait. I’m going to

"No; we only came to fetch you and thank you," she said, rewarding him

"No; what’s that for? After dinner I say things quite as good."

"Not only I, but Stiva noticed it. Just after breakfast he said to me in
"Not quite ... soon."
"Not quite, countess. Of course, his misfortune..."
"Not the least little bit," she said.
"Not the least," said Levin gloomily, as they drove up to the house.
"Not too drunk, he won’t fall down?" said Sviazhsky, shaking his head.
"Not yet."
"Not you it was performed that noble act of forgiveness, at which I was

"Now then, leave the children to themselves to get things alone and make

"Oblonsky! Here!"
"Oblonsky’s always late."
"Oblonsky’s carriage!" the porter shouted in an angry bass. The carriage

"What did Kostya say to you?"
"What did Pryatchnikov fight about?"
"What did his mother tell you?"

"What do you say, shall we go and look for mushrooms today?" said Dolly.
"What do you say, why not go after all?" said Stepan Arkadyevitch,

"What do you say? Where?"
"What do you think about the weather?"

"What would you have? The world’s made so," said Stepan Arkadyevitch.
"What you like, only not too much. Champagne," said Levin.
"What you spoke of just now was a mistake, and not love."
"What! But you said just now..."

"What! another examination!" cried the mother, with horror.
"What! disappointed in him?"
"What! do you mean to say it’s not of importance?" said Sergey

"Where are the peasants, then?"
"Where are they? That’s just the question!" said Petritsky solemnly,
"Where are they?"
"Where are you going to put the princess?" said Vronsky in French,
"Where are you going?"
"Where are you off to? Stay a little longer," he said to Varenka.
"Where are you off to?"
"Where are you off to?" asked Yashvin. "Oh, here are your three horses,"

"Where to? Home?" asked Pyotr.
"Where to?"
"Where to?" asked Pyotr before getting onto the box.
"Wherever you command."
"Where’s Cord?" he asked the stable-boy.
"Where’s my spade, mamma?"
"Whether he knows or not," said Vronsky, in his usual quiet and resolute
